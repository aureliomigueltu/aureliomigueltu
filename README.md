## About me

Hi, I'm Aurelio Miguel,

I studied Computer Engineering and Systems at the UNJBG in Tacna.

I have 6 years of experience in the field of technology, and I am starting in the world of programming, thanks to the Javascript language, which managed to convince me to continue learning to become an experienced and quality developer.

These are my first learning repositories :)

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile.
