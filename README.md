## About me

Hi, I'm Aurelio Miguel,

I currently have Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and Systems. I have accumulated 7 years of experience performing various activities in software development, virtual learning platform administration, training teachers and students, designing advertising material, providing technical support, and customer service.

I enjoy autonomous and agile learning, and every day I seek to continue learning in order to consolidate my knowledge and grow personally and professionally. 

I consider myself passionate about cultivating the arts in general. I am currently seeking training in pedagogical and didactic skills so that I can devote myself to teaching in the technological and artistic fields.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile.
